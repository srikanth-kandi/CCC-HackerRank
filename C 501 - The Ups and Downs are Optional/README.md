[C 501 : The Ups and Downs are Optional](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/may-jun-2023-ccc-lbrce-coding-practice-open/challenges/mountain-array)

**Problem Statement**
---
Array of integers is a hill, if:

- it is strictly increasing in the beginning;
- after that it is constant;
- after that it is strictly decreasing.
- The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.

For example, the following three arrays are a hill: [5, 7, 11, 11, 2, 1], [4, 4, 2], [7],
but the following three are not unimodal: [5, 5, 6, 6, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 5, 6].

Write a program that checks if an array is a hill.

**Input Format**

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

**Output Format**

Print "yes" if the given array is a hill. Otherwise, print "no".
