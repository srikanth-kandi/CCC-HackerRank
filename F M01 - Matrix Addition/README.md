**Problem Statement**
---
Just as 2D matrix, you can declare an array of as many dimensions as you want.

For example : 3D array : int arr3d[5][5][5], 4D array : int arr4d[5][5][5][5] and so on.

For this task, you are to write a program that adds two 3x3 matrices and prints the result

**Sample Input 0**

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
3 2 1
6 5 4
9 8 7
