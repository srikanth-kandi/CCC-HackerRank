[Q 802 - Inorder Traversal Restoration](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/may-jun-2023-ccc-lbrce-coding-practice-open/challenges/inorder-traversal-restoration)

**Problem Statement**
---
A complete binary tree is a binary tree where every node except the leaf node has two child nodes and the last level of the tree for an edge-height $h$ has $2^h$ leaf-nodes.

Your task is simple, given the postorder traversal for a complete binary tree, print it's inorder traversal.

The elements in the binary tree are of type character i.e. each node stores one character value.

**Input Format**

Only one string input denoting the postorder traversal.

**Constraints**

1 <= input.length <= 1000

**Output Format**

output one string that denotes the inorder traversal of the binary tree

**Sample Input 0**
