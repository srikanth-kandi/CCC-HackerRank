[B D05 - Sum of the adjacent Primes](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/may-jun-2023-ccc-lbrce-coding-practice-open/challenges/cv-7-consecutive-prime-sum)

**Problem Statement**
---
Some prime numbers can be expressed as Sum of other consecutive prime numbers.

For example

5 = 2 + 3<br>
17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7<br>
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.

Write code to find out number of prime numbers that satisfy the above mentioned property in a given range.

**Input Format:**

Each test case contains a number N <= 1000000000

**Output Format:**

Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less than or equal to N.
